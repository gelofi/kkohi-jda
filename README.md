# kkohi-jda
Kkohi, originally made in CoffeeScript, making a comeback in Java. A project to practice programming in Java.

When forking, be sure to create `Keys.java` with your keys in it! It should look like this:
```java
package org.java.kkohi;

public class Keys {
    public static String TOKEN = "put-your-token-here";
    public static String VERSION = "- Public Version";
}
```
